# Tampa_Apollo_AnthropogenicIndex
This is a replacement repository given the continuous issues I've had with the original repository titled "Apollo beach~"
Creation of 3 predictive models through evaluation of ecosystem metrics and calculated anthropogenic features.
This includes the development of a novel index designed for coastal ecosystems, conceptually adapted from the HII: Human Influence Index which focuses on terrestrial ecosystems.
There are recovery files being added to this repository as they are found.
