1. Introduction
This project introduces a new index to measure anthropogenic pressure on the Northern Tampa Bay estuary. The study focuses on the impacts of coastal construction on the ecosystem surrounding a proposed commercial dock in Apollo Beach, Florida. The research examines three primary environments: open water, seafloor, and human coastal communities.

2. Project Description
The project aims to develop a novel index to describe the potential impact of human communities and activities on the marine ecosystem. This new index will complement existing indices like the Tampa Bay Benthic Index (TBBI), Tampa Bay Nekton Index (TBNI), and the Shannon Diversity Index (SDI).

3. Current Status
The project is in the testing and validation phase, with preliminary results showing the new index effectively identifies areas of anthropogenic pressure. Further validation and refinement are ongoing.

4. Progress History
The project has progressed through data collection, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), index development, testing, and validation. Baseline models have been established for both marine and man-made ecosystems. Future work includes running additional models, refining the index, and expanding the study.

5. Data Description
The study utilizes data from various sources, including:

TBEP: TBBI, TBNI, and environmental data.
FWC: Species diversity and richness data.
Public and private records: Property development and population growth data.
6. Model Design
Linear models, time series analysis, and an LSTM Recurrent Neural Network were used to analyze the data and establish relationships between the different indices and anthropogenic pressures.

7. EDA and Preprocessing
Extensive EDA and preprocessing were performed on each dataset, including data cleaning, standardization, normalization, and feature reduction.

8. Baseline Models
Linear regression and Vector Autoregression (VAR) models were used to establish relationships between the different indices and anthropogenic pressures.

9. Results
Preliminary results suggest the new index can effectively identify areas of anthropogenic pressure and track changes over time. The LSTM model demonstrated a statistically significant relationship between the new index and existing marine ecosystem health indicators.

10. Changes to Scope of Study
The project's scope expanded from solely waterfront properties to encompass the entire watershed, including the impact of population growth and development on pollution.

11. Conclusions
The new index is a promising tool for assessing and predicting the health of marine environments, informing management decisions, and mitigating anthropogenic pressures. Further research will focus on refining the index and incorporating additional factors like geospatial analysis and land use patterns.
